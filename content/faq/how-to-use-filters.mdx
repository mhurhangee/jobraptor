# How to Use Search Filters Effectively

JobRaptor offers powerful search filters to help you find exactly what you're looking for. Here's how to make the most of them.

## Available Filters

### Location Filters

- **City/State/Country**: Enter specific locations or select "Remote" for location-independent positions
- **Distance**: Set a radius from your location (e.g., within 10 miles)
- **Relocation Support**: Filter for jobs offering relocation packages

### Job Type Filters

- **Full-time/Part-time/Contract**: Select your preferred employment type
- **Remote/Hybrid/On-site**: Filter by work arrangement
- **Entry/Mid/Senior Level**: Narrow by experience level

### Compensation Filters

- **Salary Range**: Set minimum and maximum salary expectations
- **Benefits**: Filter for specific benefits like healthcare, 401k, etc.
- **Equity Options**: Find startups or companies offering equity compensation

### Company Filters

- **Company Size**: Filter by number of employees
- **Industry**: Select specific industries
- **Funding Stage**: For startups, filter by funding round

## Filter Combinations for Best Results

The real power comes from combining filters strategically:

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with essential filters only, then add more if you get too many results
2. **Use Salary Filters Wisely**: Some great positions might not list salary; consider searching without this filter first
3. **Save Your Searches**: Once you find a good combination, save it for future use

## Common Filter Mistakes

- **Too Many Filters**: Using too many filters simultaneously can eliminate good matches
- **Outdated Location Restrictions**: With remote work now common, consider whether location is truly a dealbreaker
- **Ignoring "Similar Roles"**: Sometimes your ideal job has a different title than what you're searching for

## Advanced Filter Techniques

- **Keyword Exclusion**: Use the "-" symbol before words you want to exclude
- **Experience Level Combinations**: Select multiple adjacent levels for more results
- **Industry Crossovers**: Select multiple related industries to find transition opportunities

Remember, the perfect job might not match all your filters. Periodically try broader searches to ensure you're not missing great opportunities.
