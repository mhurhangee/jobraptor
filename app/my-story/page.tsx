              <div className="space-y-6 text-lg font-bold leading-relaxed">
                <p>
                  Picture this: You're 6 months into your job search. You've applied to 200+ positions. Your spreadsheet
                  is a mess. You can't remember which company asked for a cover letter, which one wanted salary
                  expectations, or when that "promising" interview was supposed to happen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sound familiar? That was me. A frustrated developer who realized that while we have apps for ordering
                  food, finding dates, and tracking our steps, job hunting - one of the most important activities in our
                  lives - was stuck in the stone age.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So I did what any reasonable person would do: I rage-built JobRaptor in a caffeine-fueled weekend
                  marathon. No fancy investors. No corporate BS. Just pure, unfiltered frustration channeled into code.

                  To turn job hunting from a soul-crushing nightmare into a systematic, trackable process that actually
                  works. No fluff, no corporate speak - just tools that help you land the job you deserve.

                <p className="font-bold text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Because job hunting shouldn't feel like throwing resumes into a black hole. You need visibility,
                  control, and a system that works as hard as you do. That's exactly what JobRaptor delivers.
